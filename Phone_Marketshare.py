"""
590PR: Monte Carlo Simulation of smartphone marketshare
Team Members: Saumye Kaushik, Shray Mishra

random variables: new_inventions, service_partnership, active_countries

Hypothesis:
1. Change in Market Share of a company should be more with relatively higher number of new inventions in a given timeframe.
2. An increase in service partnerships should have a positive impact on companyâ€™s market share.
3. If a company sees a rise in number of countries it is active in, it should affect the market share positively. 



Output Simulation:
1. Market Share
2. All input predictions: R&D, Revenue, Profit Margin
3. Random variable changes yoy: New_inventions, Service_partners, active_countries
